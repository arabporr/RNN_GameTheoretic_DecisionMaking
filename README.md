# Abstract
In this project, we first do a review of the paper ”A Recurrent Neural Network for Game Theoretic Decision Making” by Sudeep Bhatia and Russell Golman, 2014, introducing a computational model to solve the outcome of strategic games. Then we go through the codes which have been implemented in Matlab. There we will see the code to generate a game, ”game_creator.m”, and then the ”main.m” code, which runs the simulations in parallel using two other functions named ”stage_update.m” and ”loop_check.m”. After that, we will see my own idea to model a real-world problem and try using the taught materials in this course to face the problem, which is a market simulation with many players who are making random decisions for many rounds and making supply and demand which results in changes in price.
