# RNN_GameTheoretic_DecisionMaking
In this project, we first review the paper ”A Recurrent Neural Network for Game Theoretic Decision Making” by Sudeep Bhatia and Russell Golman, 2014, introducing a computational model to solve the outcome of strategic games. Then we go through the codes which have been implemented in Matlab.
